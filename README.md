A.  Create a timeline of the UX design activities that will take place during this project.



Note: Your timeline does not need to reflect the exact amount of time you will spend on each activity. You may use any tool to create your timeline, including word processing software, a spreadsheet, project management software, presentation software, or another tool of your choice.



Note: The file size limit for your timeline cannot be more than 16 MB. Files larger than 16 MB will not be accepted.



B.  Create a persona profile based on the attached “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents.



C.  Create a low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of your new design for the Tanitian website.



Note: You can use any tool to create the wireframe, such as graphic creation/manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.



D.  Conduct guerrilla usability testing with at least three user testers and then do the following:

1.  Summarize the qualitative feedback you received, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable and relevant to your design.

2.  Explain how you will incorporate the feedback you received to improve your design.



E.  Create an interactive prototype for the Tanitian website that reflects your wireframe design and incorporates the feedback you received during guerrilla testing. Your prototype must be submitted as a URL link.



Note: You can use any tool to create your prototype, such as webpage creation software, GUI editors, or other web development API (e.g., InVision).



F.  List five objective usability tasks you want users to test in Task 2 for your prototype.



G. Acknowledge sources, using APA-formatted in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.



H. Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
